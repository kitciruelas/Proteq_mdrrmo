## Summary
Successfully modified the reset password page to only display new password and confirm password fields. Email and OTP are now handled from the previous verify-otp page's state, providing a cleaner user experience. The backend API remains unchanged and fully compatible.

## Bug Fix
Fixed a critical bug in the backend `resetPassword` function where it was calling the wrong OTP verification function. Changed `verifyOTP(email, otp)` to `verifyOTPFromStore(email, otp)` to use the correct imported function from the otpStore utility.
